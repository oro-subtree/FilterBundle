OroFilterBundle
===============

Main goal of OroFilterBundle is to provide reusable set of components to represent filters on frontend
and to provide their data on backed. Filters on frontend are represented with interactive widgets
powered by javascript. On side of application backend filters are represented with standad symfony form types.
It also means that filtering logic itself is out of scope of this bundle.
